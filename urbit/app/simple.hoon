::  INTRO/THE BIG PICTURE
::
::  SSS is intended to function as a *state replication system*. Agent A has a
::  piece of mutable state it wants to make available to its subscribers, and
::  the subscribers should be able to keep in sync with minimal work.
::
::  There exist two obvious solutions to this problem. First, Agent A could send
::  out the entire state every time it changes, but this is obviously wasteful.
::
::  The more efficient solution is for A to only send out instructions on how to
::  *update* the state, but then any subscribed Agent B has to manually
::  interpret these, update its own state, and risk getting some detail wrong.
::  Even if this is done correctly, reimplementing this common pattern in many
::  agents is obviously both wasting wetware and cluttering codebases.
::
::  SSS is how we plan to implement the second solution in kernelspece, reducing
::  code overhead, network load and memory usage at the same time. The prototype
::  library that this current agent demonstrates the usage of does not quite
::  achieve all of those things -- specifically there will be lots of
::  boilerplate -- but it does give us a chance to see how ergonomic this
::  programming is in practice.
::
::
::  USAGE
::
::  In order to replicate a particular kind of state, we need a `lake`.
::  A `lake` is a polymorphic core of the shape:
::  |$  [rok wav]
::  |%
::  +$  rock  rok
::  +$  wave  wav
::  ++  wash  |=  [rok wav]  *rok
::  ++  name  *term
::  --
::
::  - `rock` is the type of the state to be replicated.
::  - `wave` is the type of the diff or "update instruction" that the
::    publisher emits every time it wants to update its published state.
::  - `wash` is a gate which takes an old state and a diff to a new state.
::  - `name` is not conceptually part of the `lake` but has to be there for this
::    prototype. It should be the name of the lake file.
::
:::::::::::::::::::
::
::  In this demo, `lake`s are stored in /sur:
/-  sum, sum-0  ::  , log
::  NOTE: The publisher and all subscribers need to share the exact same `lake`!
::
::  Each lake also has to have a matching mar file: mar/<name:lake>/hoon.
::  It can be automatically generated this way:
::::::::::::::::::
::  /-  log
::  /+  *sss
::  (mk-mar log)
::::::::::::::::::
::
::  We also import the sss library itself from /lib:
/+  verb, dbug, *sss
::
%-  agent:dbug
%+  verb  &
::
::  In order to subscribe to a state, the agent declares the lake it wants to
::  use and on which paths the states of that shape can be received.
::
::  Here, the `log` lake will be used to manage states on the path `/log`:
::  =/  sub-log  (mk-subs log ,[%log ~])
::  Note that the path is specified as a mold! This does not mean that you are
::  free to use molds that aren't path-shaped. Your agent will compile, but you
::  will get runtime errors and the library won't work.
::
::  Similarly, the `sum` lake will be used to manage states on paths starting
::  with `/sum`, e.g. `/sum/foo`, `/sum` or `/sum/foo/bar`.
=/  sub-sum  (mk-subs sum ,[%sum *])
::
::  In order to publish a state, the agent makes the exact same declaration,
::  using a `lake` and a `path` expressed as a mold.
::  =/  pub-log  (mk-pubs log ?([%log *] [%other-log ~]))  ::NOTE $? can be used!
=/  pub-sum  (mk-pubs sum ,[%sum %foo ~])
::  Note that these paths aren't exactly identical to the ones used for
::  subscriptions! There is no requirement that the publisher and the subscriber
::  will share the full set of paths, just that they overlap on at least one.

    ::  The data structures created above are managed using two cores. For
    ::  subscriptions there's `da` and for publications there's `du`.
    ::
    ::  `da` and `du` need to be initialized in two steps.
    ::
    ::  First, you monomorphize their types, using the same arguments as when

::  Most of the magic happens in `+on-poke`. The SSS library will give your

::
::  - %sss-on-rock
::    Received whenever a state you're subscribed to has updated.
::  - %sss-to-pub
::    Information to be handled by a du-core (i.e. a publication).
::  - %sss-<lake> (e.g. %sss-log or %sss-sum)
::    Information to be handled by a da-core (i.e. a subscription).
::  - %sss-surf-fail
::    Received whenever you try to subscribe without being allowed.
::
::  We will go through all of these below.
::
::  In this example agent, there are also several pokes that simply make the
::  agent do things like open a subscription or reclaim memory used by a
::  publication. Normally, these would be used wherever you need them, but here
::  they're gathered in `+on-poke` because it allows triggering them from the

  ::  where:

  ::    Your agent simply crashed while getting notified of a new state. This is

::  Apart from `+on-poke`, the SSS library also uses `+on-agent` to keep track
::  of when the agent failed to handle an `%sss-on-rock` poke. Essentially,
::  whenever a new state is received, the library causes the agent to poke
::  itself with an `%sss-on-rock` poke, and if that gives back a nack, it will
::  update the failure flag of that rock to `%.y`.
::
::  The acks from `%sss-on-rock` pokes will come over wires shaped like:
::  //sss/on-rock/[aeon]/[ship]/[dude]/[path] (the leading `//` means that the
::  head of the wire is `~`). As a developer you don't need to care about the
::  elements in the middle, only that there are three of them. The thing you do
::  need to do is the branch on the path if you have several types of
::  subscriptions, to determine which of the `da` cores you should use.
::
::  Once you've branched on the path, strip the first three elements of the wire
::  using `|3` and pass it to `+chit:da` and update the data structure for the
::  corresponding subscription with the result. Return a quip with no cards.
